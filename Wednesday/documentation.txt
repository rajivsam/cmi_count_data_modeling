1. Loaded the excel data using pandas and created "retail" dataframe

2. The dataframe contained the columns "InvoiceNo", "StockCode", "Description", "Quantity", "InvoiceDate", "UnitPrice", "CustomerID", "Country". But since our task is to capture for each business day, the number of registered store customers who made purchases during a particular hour of the day, our focus is the columns "InvoiceDate", "CustomerID" of the retail dataframe. So I created a new dataframe "Rdf" contaning the columns "InvoiceDate" and "CustomerID" of the retail dataframe as "Date" and "Customers" respectively.

3. Checked if the dates are sorted or not. Since they were already sorted there is no need to sort the "Customers" coloumn w.r.t. the "Date" column.

4. Now the "Date" starts at "2010-12-01 08:26:00" and ends at "2011-12-09 12:50:00" but we want data for every hour of each day. Hence, I added two new rows at the begining and end of the Rdf dataframe containing for timestamp "2010-12-01 00:00:00" under "Date", the customerID who made transaction i.e. null under "Customers" and for timestamp "2011-12-09 23:00:00" under "Date", the customerID who made transaction i.e. null under "Customers" respectively.

5. Counted the number of unique customerId's for each hour of a day. So, the value under "Customers" for timestamp say "2011-12-09 10:00:00" under "Date" means the number of unique customerID's who made transaction(s) between 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on December 9th, 2011.

6. Splitted the timestamps under "Date" into Date and Time under columns "Day" and "Time" respectively.

7. Converted the Rdf dataframe into a dataframe with "00:00:00", "01:00:00",..., "23:00:00", 24 hours of a day as its coloumns and the business days, from 2010-12-01 to 2011-12-09, as its rows, the values of the dataframe being the number of unique customerIDs who made purchases during a particular hour of a particular day.
