SK, 23/07/2021: Learned how to work with github. Studied the original dataset and created an ipynb file that produces a dataset that captures the week 1 task.
AI, 26/07/2021: Revised pandas, updated last week works- considered unregistered customers and cancelled transactions in customer_per_hour.ipynb.
AI, 27/07/2021: Analysed missing dates in customer_per_hour dataset.
AI, 28/07/2021: Dropped less important columns, Assigned quarter for all the dates.
AI, 29/07/2021: Plotted boxplot for all the quarter. Plotted the moving averages.
SK, 30/07/2021: Dropped the rows corresponding to unregistered customers and cancelled transactions. Wrote code for week 2 tasks. Plotted weekly MA plots for each quarter.
AI, 30/07/2021: Inserted 0 values for all the missing dates and re-done all the tasks.
SK, 06/08/2021: Plotted weekly heatmap for data of 2011 and weekly heatmaps for data of each quarter of 2011. Studied about GAM (Generalized Additive Model). Built intuition about the nature of missing data.
AI, 04/08/2021: Discussed some issues about the week number with SK and completed Week 3, Task 1.
AI, 05/08/2021: Plotted the heatmaps to identify missing data.Studied GAM.
AI, 06/08/2021: Redo the heatmaps for all quarters. Reviewed GAM. Studied differnt type of missing datas.
AI, 07/08/2021: Reviewed the 3 missing data types- MCAR, MAR, MNAR and identified the missing types in our dataset.
AI, 09/08/2021: Studied pandas time series functionality. Agreed on week convention for week 3 tasks with SK and corrected the tasks.
AI, 10/08/2021: Studied PACF, reviewed pandas time series functionality.
AI, 11/08/2021: Reviewed PACF, pandas time series functionality.Discussed with SK about the implementation of the tasks.
AI, 12/08/2021: Completed task 1 of this week.
AI, 13/08/2021: Completed task 2 for week 4
